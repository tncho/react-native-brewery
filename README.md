## Installation

### Local

For the best experience, you should consider downloading the Expo XDE client from their 'Downloads' page, Genymotion & Android Tools with the emulator.
After these steps, simply run the following command in the project root folder

```
npm install
```

Note: debugging was made easier thanks to this article by James Best:

### Remote

Or, try it out via the [Expo demo](https://expo.io/@tncho) 

## Built with 

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) - Code once, run anywhere. Get the best out of native mobile code built with bleeding edge technologies from the JavaScript ecosystem, HTML, CSS and a rich set of community libraries.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html) - React Navigation is born from the React Native community's need for an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution written entirely in JavaScript (so you can read and understand all of the source), on top of powerful native primitives.
- [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) - Essential cross-platform UI components for React Native
- [Expo](https://expo.io/) - Free and open source toolchain built around React Native to build native iOS and Android projects using JavaScript and React.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [Normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) - Normalizes nested JSON according to a schema
- [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) - Search through Brewdog's expansive back catalogue of beer in a programmatic way


## To-do
- Replace NPM with YARN as the package management tool. (completed)
- Add unit tests
- Complete the search feature (todo: Favorite feature)
- Implement Redux & Firebase
